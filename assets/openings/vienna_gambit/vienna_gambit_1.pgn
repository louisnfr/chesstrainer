1. e4 {We kick things off with e4 — classic move. Grabs space in the center and opens up lines for the queen and bishop.}
1... e5

2. Nc3 {Knight to c3. Simple development, and now we’re officially in the Vienna Game.}
2... Nf6

3. f4 {Since Black played Nf6, it’s time for the Vienna Gambit. We throw out f4, offering a pawn to take over the center and open the game.}
3... exf4

4. e5 {They take the pawn? Perfect. Now we hit e5 and force their knight to run. It doesn’t have anywhere good to go.}
4... Ng8

5. Nf3 {Knight drops back to g8. We play Nf3 to stop their queen from jumping to h4 with check — that would’ve been annoying.}
5...Nc6

6. d4 {Push d4. We’re locking down the center and getting ready to bring out the bishop.}
6...d6

7. Bxf4 {Bishop takes on f4. We grab our pawn back and develop another piece. Clean.}
7...dxe5

8. Nxe5 {Black takes in the center. We’ve got three ways to respond, but knight takes e5 is the best. Taking with the pawn or bishop just helps Black trade stuff off.}
8...Nxe5

9. Bxe5 {We take back with the bishop. Keeps the pressure on and avoids simplifying too early.}

* {That’s it — you’ve got all your material back and a nice lead in development. Looking great from here.}
