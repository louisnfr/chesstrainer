1. e4 {Welcome to the Vienna Gambit! Let's start with e4, grabbing space in the center and getting our pieces ready to roll.}
1... e5

2. Nc3 {Time for Nc3. We're developing with purpose and setting up the Vienna Game foundation.}
2... Nf6

3. f4 {Time for f4! We're launching the Vienna Gambit, offering this pawn to crack open the center and put pressure on Black's e5 pawn.}
3... d6

4. Nf3 {They play the solid d6 instead of taking our pawn. No worries, we develop with Nf3, protecting our center and keeping things flexible.}
4... Nc6

5. Bb5 {Here comes Bb5! Black developed their knight to c6, so we pin it right away. Classic pressure on their position and they'll need to deal with this bishop.}

* {Nice work! You've got active pieces, central control, and Black has some tough decisions to make about that pinned knight. The position is looking sharp and promising.}
