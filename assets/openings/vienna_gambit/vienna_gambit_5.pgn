1. e4 {Welcome to the Vienna Gambit! We open with e4, claiming our share of the center and getting ready for action.}
1... e5

2. Nc3 {Nc3 develops the knight and puts us into Vienna Game territory. Solid development with tactical ideas brewing.}
2... Nf6

3. f4 {Here we go with f4! The Vienna Gambit is on the table, offering a pawn to open up the position and create attacking chances.}
3... Nc6

4. fxe5 {Black develops instead of taking our pawn, so we grab theirs with fxe5! Now their knight on f6 is under attack and has to move.}
4... Nxe5

5. d4 {Perfect! We strike with d4, kicking their centralized knight and taking control of the center.}
5... Ng6

6. e5 {The knight retreats to g6, so we push e5! This advance cramps Black's position and forces their other knight to make a tough choice.}
6... Ng8

7. Nf3 {Knight had to retreat all the way back to g8. We complete our development with Nf3, keeping everything solid while maintaining our space advantage.}

* {Excellent work! You've got a beautiful pawn center, active pieces, and Black's knights are completely out of play. This is exactly what White wants from the Vienna Gambit.}
