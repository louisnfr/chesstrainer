1. e4 {Let's learn one of the most crushing openings for White: The Vienna. Start by pushing the king's pawn forward two squares to e4.}
1... e5

2. Nc3 {Now develop the queen's knight to c3, which begins the Vienna Game.}
2... Nf6

3. f4 {The Vienna Gambit is played after Black plays knight f6. Let's gambit our f pawn by pushing it 2 squares forward.}
3... d6

4. Nf3 {If Black wants to deny the gambit, they must do it with the d-pawn. In this case, it's quite straightforward. Let's develop our king's knight to f3.}
4... exf4

5. d4 {Taking our pawn is a mistake for Black! If we push our pawn to d4, we can take the center and open up our bishop to recapture the pawn.}

* {Well done! We own the center and are about to win back our material!}
