1. e4 {Welcome to the Vienna Gambit! We kick things off with e4 — classic move. Grabs space in the center and opens up lines for the queen and bishop.}
1... e5

2. Nc3 {Knight to c3. Simple development, and now we’re officially in the Vienna Game.}
2... Nf6

3. f4 {Since Black played Nf6, it’s time for the Vienna Gambit. We throw out f4, offering a pawn to take over the center and open the game.}
3... d6

4. Nf3 {If Black wants to dodge the gambit, pushing the d-pawn is the way. No problem — we just develop naturally with Nf3.}
4... exf4

5. d4{They take the pawn? Perfect. Push d4. We’re locking down the center and getting ready to bring out the bishop to take the pawn back.}

* {That’s it — we own the center and we’re about to win our material back. Nice.}
