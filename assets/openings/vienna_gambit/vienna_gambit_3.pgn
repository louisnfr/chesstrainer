1. e4 {Welcome to the Vienna Gambit! We kick things off with e4 — classic move. Grabs space in the center and opens up lines for the queen and bishop.}
1... e5

2. Nc3 {Knight to c3. Simple development, and now we’re officially in the Vienna Game.}
2... Nf6

3. f4 {Since Black played Nf6, it’s time for the Vienna Gambit. We throw out f4, offering a pawn to take over the center and open the game.}
3... exf4

4. e5 {They take the pawn? Perfect. Now we hit e5 and force their knight to run. It doesn’t have anywhere good to go.}
4... Nh5

5. Qxh5 {Well that's a blunder. Can you spot the winning move here ?}

* {Excellent work punishing that mistake! It's amazing how frequently players refuse to retreat their knight and end up losing the whole piece}
